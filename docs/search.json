    "text": "Background\nThe Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County started in January 7, 2025 and subsequently burned over 20,000 acres, devastating local communities, damaging thousands of homes and many acres of ecological habitat, and leaving deep scars in both the communities they affected and the land itself. In this study, we will visualize the extents and impacts of the Eaton and Palisades fires using false color imagery through Landsat data and known perimeters of both fires, and focus in on an environmental justice metric to assess the community’s potential response to wildfire.\nTo learn more about false color images and landsats, see the following resources:\nWhy is that Forest Red and that Cloud Blue? How to Interpret a False-Color Satellite Image\nWhat are the band designations for the Landsat satellites?\nCommon Landsat Band Combinations\n\nAnalysis Highlights\nIn this study, we will highlight the following skills:\n\nExamining rioxarrays and NetCDF files to pull, transform, and manipulate spatial data.\nMap true and false color images from NetCDF files.\nMap census tracts that intersect the Eaton and Palisades fires to explore potential injustices.\n\n\n\nDatasets:\nLandsat data are from Microsoft Planetary Computer data catalogue. These data contain bands for red, green, blue, near-infrared and shortwave infrared, from the Landsat Collection 2 Level-2 collected by Landsat-8. Our data is cropped to areas surrounding the extent of the fires.\nPerimeter data are from Los Angeles County Dissolved Fire Perimeter Data. These data originate from data containing daily snapshots of perimeters, but are dissolved into one layer for these data.\nFire perimeter data: https://geohub.lacity.org/maps/ad51845ea5fb4eb483bc2a7c38b2370c/about Landsat data: https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/landsat-c2-l2\nEJI data are from the Environmental Justice Index (EJI), a national tool to measure environmental burden. The EJI ranks tracts for 36 different factors developed from data from many different sources.\n\n\nRepository:\nAll code and output for this blogpost are housed on GitHub.\nBegin by loading all necessary libraries and data.\n\n# Load libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas as gpd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nimport xarray as xr\nimport contextily as ctx\nfrom matplotlib_scalebar.scalebar import ScaleBar\n\n\n# Load data\n\n# Read in NetCDF file\nfp_landsat = os.path.join(\"data\", \"landsat8-2025-02-23-palisades-eaton.nc\")\nlandsat = xr.open_dataset(fp_landsat)\n\n# Read in perimeter data\nfp_eaton = os.path.join(\"data\", \"Eaton_Perimeter\", \"Eaton_Perimeter_20250121.shp\")\nfp_palisades = os.path.join(\"data\", \"Palisades_Perimeter\", \"Palisades_Perimeter_20250121.shp\")\neaton_perimeter = gpd.read_file(fp_eaton)\npalisades_perimeter = gpd.read_file(fp_palisades)\n\n# Import CA EJI gdb\nfp = os.path.join(\"data\", \"EJI_2024_California\", \"EJI_2024_California.gdb\")\neji_california = gpd.read_file(fp)"

    "text": "Creative License\nMarine aquaculture has grown substantially globally and has both positive and negative economic, ecological, and sustainability potential1. Gentry et al2 estimated global seafood demand could be met using less than 0.015% of global ocean area. The United States is among the top countries with large marine aquaculture potential, likely due to long coastlines and exclusive economic zones3 (sea area 200 nm from a coastal baseline in which a sovereign state has exclusive rights).\n\n\nWith the rise of global seafood demand, we must leverage our marine aquaculture potential to meet the growing need. In order to maximize potential, we need to determine potential aquaculture locations based on optimizing habitat suitability for our aquaculture species of interest. In this study, we will develop a workflow to determine which exclusive economic zones (EEZ) are best suited for species of oysters and red abalone, two culturally and economically import species for seafood, based on suitable sea surface temperature and depth."

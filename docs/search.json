In this study, we will visualize the extents and impacts of the Eaton and Palisades fires using false color imagery through landsat data and known perimeters of both fires, and focus in on an environmental justice metric to assess the community’s potential response to wildfire.\nTo learn more about false color images and landsats, see the following resources:\nWhy is that Forest Red and that Cloud Blue?
